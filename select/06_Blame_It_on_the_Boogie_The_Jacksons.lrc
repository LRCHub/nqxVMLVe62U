[00:17.94] My baby's always dancin' and it wouldn't be a bad thing
[00:22.64] But I don't get no loving and that's no lie
[00:26.74] We spent the night in Frisco at every kinda disco
[00:31.22] From that night I kissed our love goodbye
[00:34.67] Don't blame it on the sunshine
[00:36.79] Don't blame it on the moonlight
[00:38.91] Don't blame it on the good times
[00:41.24] Blame it on the boogie
[00:43.10] Don't blame it on the sunshine
[00:45.27] Don't blame it on the moonlight
[00:47.26] Don't blame it on the good times
[00:49.68] Blame it on the boogie
[00:52.28] That nasty boogie bugs me, but somehow how it has drugged me
[00:56.64] Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
[01:00.61] I've changed my life completely, I've seen the lightning leave me
[01:04.73] And my baby just can't take her eyes off me
[01:08.50] Don't blame it on the sunshine
[01:10.82] Don't blame it on the moonlight
[01:12.94] Don't blame it on the good times
[01:15.35] Blame it on the boogie
[01:16.85] Don't you blame it on the sunshine
[01:19.12] Don't blame it on the moonlight
[01:21.36] Don't blame it on the good times
[01:23.89] Blame it on the boogie, woo
[01:26.36] I just can't, I just can't
[01:28.69] I just can't control my feet
[01:30.68] I just can't, I just can't
[01:32.76] I just can't control my feet
[01:34.88] I just can't, I just can't
[01:36.95] I just can't control my feet
[01:39.03] I just can't, I just can't
[01:41.02] I just can't control my feet
[01:43.18] Sunshine
[01:44.47] Don't blame it on the moonlight
[01:46.55] Don't blame it on the good times
[01:48.87] Blame it on the boogie
[01:50.76] Don't blame it on the sunshine
[01:52.94] Don't blame it on the moonlight
[01:55.00] Don't on the good times
[01:57.46] Blame it on the boogie
[02:08.46] 
[02:08.21] This magic music grooves me, that dirty rhythm fools me
[02:12.78] The Devil's gotten to me through this dance
[02:16.73] I'm full of funky fever, a fire burns inside me
[02:21.28] Boogie's got me in a super trance
[02:24.71] Don't blame it on the sunshine
[02:27.04] Don't blame it on the moonlight
[02:29.03] Don't blame it on the good times
[02:31.42] Blame it on the boogie
[02:33.07] Don't you blame it sunshine
[02:35.26] Don't blame it on the moonlight
[02:37.56] Don't blame it on the good times
[02:39.92] Blame it on the boogie
[02:41.68] Aow!
