My baby's always dancing
And it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no loving
And that's no lie

We spent the night in Frisco
At every kind of disco
From that night I kissed
Our love goodbye

Chorus
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

Chorus
Don't you blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

That nasty boogie bugs me
But somehow it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm get me
On my feet

I've changed my life completely
I've seen the lightning leave me
My baby just can't take
Her eyes off me

Chorus
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

Chorus
Don't you blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

Bridge
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't control myself

I just can't
I just can't
I just can't control myself...

Chorus
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

Chorus
Don't you blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

This magic music grooves me
That dirty rhythm moves me
The devil's gotten to me
Through this dance

I'm full of funky fever
A fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a
Super trance

Chorus
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

Chorus
Don't you blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

Sunshine
Moonlight
Good times
Boogie

Sunshine
Moonlight
Good times
Boogie

Don't you blame it
You just got to
You just want to
Yea -
Blame it on yourself
Ain't nobody's fault
But yours and that boogie
Dancing all night long

Yours and that boogie
Ain't nobody's fault
But yours
Dancing all night long
