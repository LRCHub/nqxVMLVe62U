[00:16.97] My baby's always dancin' and it wouldn't be a bad thing
[00:21.61] But I don't get no loving and that's no lie
[00:25.77] We spent the night in Frisco at every kinda disco
[00:30.23] From that night I kissed our love goodbye
[00:50.73] 
[00:33.68] Don't blame it on the sunshine
[00:35.72] Don't blame it on the moonlight
[00:37.95] Don't blame it on the good times
[00:40.22] Blame it on the boogie
[00:51.22] 
[00:42.11] Don't blame it on the sunshine
[00:44.26] Don't blame it on the moonlight
[00:46.26] Don't blame it on the good times
[00:48.66] Blame it on the boogie
[00:59.66] 
[00:51.22] That nasty boogie bugs me, but somehow how it has drugged me
[00:55.68] Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
[00:59.63] I've changed my life completely, I've seen the lightning leave me
[01:03.79] And my baby just can't take her eyes off me
[01:25.29] 
[01:07.53] Don't blame it on the sunshine
[01:09.82] Don't blame it on the moonlight
[01:11.98] Don't blame it on the good times
[01:14.40] Blame it on the boogie
[01:25.40] 
[01:15.81] Don't you blame it on the sunshine
[01:18.12] Don't blame it on the moonlight
[01:20.32] Don't blame it on the good times
[01:22.83] Blame it on the boogie, woo
[01:36.33] 
[01:25.30] I just can't, I just can't
[01:27.69] I just can't control my feet
[01:29.67] I just can't, I just can't
[01:31.77] I just can't control my feet
[01:33.84] I just can't, I just can't
[01:35.92] I just can't control my feet
[01:38.08] I just can't, I just can't
[01:40.01] I just can't control my feet
[01:54.01] 
[01:42.12] Sunshine

[01:54.03] Don't on the good times
[01:56.46] Blame it on the boogie
[02:07.46] 
[02:07.25] This magic music grooves me, that dirty rhythm fools me
[02:11.80] The Devil's gotten to me through this dance
[02:15.72] I'm full of funky fever, a fire burns inside me
[02:20.26] Boogie's got me in a super trance
[02:36.76] 
[02:23.77] Don't blame it on the sunshine
[02:26.05] Don't blame it on the moonlight
[02:28.07] Don't blame it on the good times
[02:30.41] Blame it on the boogie
[02:41.41]

[02:34.23] Don't blame it on the moonlight
